# product-manager review of context-garden/phase-04

**Persona:** product-manager · **Score:** 7/10 · 2026-09-05T22:51:04+00:00

Phase 04 shipped 59 of 60 tasks and made the leaveability promise true in mechanism: the tick no longer blocks the UI, config reloads live, a quota error pauses the harness, a restart reaps finished runs, the queue merges hard-tier PRs and the three security highs are closed, while the operator's share of spend fell from half to under a third. But three definition-of-done numbers moved the wrong way (hand merges 16 of 57, cost per easy task $5.04, rebase rounds 1.57 per merge), first-pass approval fell from 93% to 71-79%, and two DoD lines (the walkthrough, tick duration) were never measured. The phase also grew wide (60 tasks against phase 03's 37), and the retro machinery now files every persona finding as a draft, which risks recreating the drafts-only Inbox. Phase 05 should measure cost per accepted task before routing anything, finish the review-queue promise on every runner, and keep onboarding as its one headline.

## High

- **cost** — First-pass approval fell to 71-79% and cost per easy task rose to $5.04, and the garden has no cost-per-accepted-task or first-pass-approval metric by model, so the phase-05 routing experiment cannot be read.
  - suggestion: Add cost per accepted task and first-pass approval per model, tier and harness to garden metrics, the Costs page and the retro Numbers section before CG-213 or CG-230 dispatch.
- **hand merges** — 16 of 57 merges were by hand against a goal of zero; trial winners and manual-runner tasks never enter the review queue and waited 45 and 51 minutes for a press.
  - suggestion: Widen CG-236 so any PR with no review recorded for its head is queued on the next tick, on every runner, and make resume mean the same on the manual runner.

## Medium

- **retro output** — CG-187 files every finding at every severity from seven personas as a draft, plus features, spikes and doc tasks, so one retro can drop forty drafts into the next phase's approve queue.
  - suggestion: File only high findings as drafts, render the rest on the retro page with a one-press file-as-task, and cap and report what the retro held back.
- **definition of done** — No phase-04 walkthrough was captured, tick duration appears only in the CLI tick summary, and hand merges were counted by hand, so three DoD lines were guessed.
  - suggestion: Have garden retro capture the walkthrough before personas run, and add hand merges and tick duration to garden metrics and the rail.
- **operating profiles** — The built-in stops hard-code Claude model ids and economy routes hard-tier work to haiku, which is wrong for a codex-only or work garden and contradicts the phase's own cost finding.
  - suggestion: Let a stop name a tier per harness or reference each harness's tier map, and revisit economy's hard tier.
- **operator hand steps** — Re-dispatching a task to another harness leaves the old worker running in the same worktree (one $4.34 run with no PR), and moving the pin is still a multi-step hand sequence.
  - suggestion: Add a redispatch command that kills the active run's process tree first, and a pin command that runs the canary, installs and restarts after a tick.

## Low

- **copy and docs** — The Config page shows a task id (CG-221) as a heading and an empty retro column in the stops table; the operator skill template still says config changes need a restart; design.md and roadmap.md list automatic merging as not planned while the queue is on.
  - suggestion: Drop task ids from user-facing copy, fill or remove the retro column, and update scaffold.py's skill template, docs/design.md and docs/roadmap.md.
- **brief gate** — garden take flips a draft straight to ready without the brief-gap check approve enforces.
  - suggestion: Route take through Scheduler.approve so placeholder criteria are refused on every path.

## Full report

_Restored by the operator from the run output after the run was misread as a login failure (CG-237)._

Phase 04 review as product manager. I read the phase-04 friction log and operator retro, the phase-05 stub and its five drafts, the phase-03 walkthrough (the latest one; phase 04 has none), and rendered the current build's Inbox, Board, Config, Costs and phase pages on a throwaway garden. The full suite passes on this checkout.

| check | result |
|---|---|
| `PYTHONPATH=src .venv/bin/pytest -q -x` | 961 passed, 3 skipped |
| phase-04 tasks | 59 done, 1 cancelled (CG-189, redone as CG-225) |

**1. Vision.** context-garden turns a repository of written intent into merged pull requests while the person who wrote it is away, and asks that person only for the decisions a person must make.

Three phases from now, done looks like this. A second team points the garden at a repository they already have and gets a working garden in one sitting, on the models and machines they already pay for. They approve the planner's tasks, close the laptop, and in the morning the board shows merged PRs at every tier, the Inbox shows only real decisions, and a quota outage or a config change cost nobody a hand. A manager opens the Costs page and reads cost per accepted task by model and tier, and the tier map is set from that number rather than from a vendor's price list. The retro reads its own walkthrough, delivers a verdict, and leaves the owner a list to edit that fits on one screen. The plain interactive session is the fallback for one task in twenty.

**2. Where we are.** Phase 04 finished the leaveability promise in mechanism: the tick no longer blocks the UI, garden.yaml reloads live, a quota error pauses the harness instead of failing twelve tasks, a restart reaps what the old process finished, the queue merges hard-tier PRs, and the three security highs are closed. Against that, three definition-of-done numbers went the wrong way: hand merges rose to 16 of 57, cost per easy task rose to $5.04, first-pass approval fell from 93% to 71–79%, and rebase rounds per merge sit at 1.57 against a goal of 0.2. Two lines of the definition of done were never measured: there is no phase-04 walkthrough, and tick duration shows only in the CLI's tick summary.

What a person sees today is better than the phase-03 walkthrough. That walkthrough's Inbox read "13 need you" where all thirteen were drafts, with fragments like "] Tests cover the CLI and the web action" leaking into the cards, and its Config page said "edit the underlying YAML files" beside a Set button. The current build's Config page reads "the scheduler re-reads garden.yaml … each tick when the file changes, so an edit takes effect within one tick with no restart", the rail carries an operating-profile select reading "economy · balanced · fast" and a "Notify me in this browser" toggle, and a new phase's page opens on "No kickoff report yet. Before this phase's tasks start taking runs, a planner-tier review can flag design gaps…". The Costs page exists and slices by activity, model, phase and operator session. The surface has caught up with the mechanism.

**3. Features for the next phase.** Ranked by user value per unit of cost. The first five finish phase-04 promises; the last three are phase-05's own.

1. **Cost per accepted task and first-pass approval are the garden's headline numbers, per model, tier and harness.** The operator's own measurement is the finding of the phase: sonnet halved the run price and did not lower the bill per task, because it needed more revise and review rounds. Nothing in `garden metrics` or the Costs page reports cost per accepted task or first-pass approval by model today, so the phase-05 routing experiment cannot be read when it finishes. Add both to the metrics command, the Costs page breakdown and the retro's Numbers section, with accepted meaning merged to the base branch. Size: medium. Depends on CG-233 and CG-214, both merged. File it first: CG-213 and CG-230 are worthless without it.

2. **Every path that produces a PR ends in the review queue, and resume, review and accept mean the same on every runner.** Two trial winners waited 45 and 51 minutes for a hand press; a manual-runner task ignores resume. CG-236 covers the trial winner and is filed as easy in phase 05; widen it to the manual runner and to any PR the poll finds with no review recorded for its head. Size: easy to medium. Depends on nothing.

3. **The retro leaves the owner a list they can triage in one sitting.** CG-187 files every finding at every severity from seven personas as a draft, the product-manager persona adds five to eight features, and kickoff adds spikes and doc tasks. One retro can drop forty drafts into the next phase, and the Inbox's approve queue becomes the "13 need you" page again. File high findings as drafts; render medium and low as rows on the retro page with a one-press "file as task"; cap the retro's own drafts and say on the page what was held back. Size: medium. Depends on CG-146 and CG-187, merged. Check the count from this retro before deciding the cap.

4. **Recurring hand steps become commands: re-dispatch kills the superseded worker, and the pin moves with one command.** Re-dispatching a task from codex to fable left two workers in one worktree and cost $4.34 for a run with no PR. Moving the pin is a canary, an install and a restart timed after a tick, done by hand each time. Add a `redispatch` that kills the active run's process tree before it starts the new one, and a `pin` command that runs the canary, installs, waits for the tick boundary and restarts. Size: medium. Depends on CG-180 and CG-198, merged.

5. **The retro captures its own walkthrough, and the definition of done is measured by the tool.** Phase 04's definition of done named a walkthrough that was never captured, a tick duration that only the CLI prints, and hand merges the operator counted by hand. `garden retro` runs `garden walkthrough` before the personas and refuses to run them without it; `garden metrics` reports hand merges as merged PRs the queue did not merge, and mean and maximum tick duration; the rail shows the last tick's duration beside its time. Size: easy. Depends on CG-182 and CG-201, merged.

6. **Operating-profile stops are harness-aware, and user-facing copy drops task ids.** The built-in stops hard-code Claude model ids, so a codex-only or work garden gets a stop that names models its harness cannot run, and economy sends hard-tier work to haiku, which the operator's numbers say costs more per task, not less. Let a stop name a tier per harness or reference each harness's own tier map. The Config page also carries "CG-221" as a heading and shows "—" in every row of the stops table's retro column. Size: easy. Depends on CG-221, merged.

7. **Onboarding: `garden onboard` drafts a garden from an existing repository (CG-215).** This is the week-one feature for the next user and the right headline for phase 05. The draft is complete; keep it as written, with one change: it must produce a `garden doctor` pass on a non-Python fixture with no hand edits, and it should run its planner under the same brief gate as approve so no placeholder criteria ship. Size: hard. Depends on item 1 only in ranking, not in code; on CG-193 and CG-224, merged.

8. **A tier names several harness and model options and dispatch spreads runs across them (CG-230).** Both accounts hit their quota on the same day, and CG-212 now knows when a harness is paused. The pool is the cheap way to keep the loop working through an outage, and it records the member on each run so item 1 can compare them. Size: medium. Depends on CG-212 and item 1 for the reporting.

**4. Not now.**

- **Workers on independent remote hosts over HTTP (CG-216).** Hard, and its user is a build farm or a colleague's laptop that does not exist yet. The ssh runner covers the second machine a small team has today. Defer until a named second team asks; it carries a new auth surface and a third runner.
- **OpenRouter as a built-in agent loop (option a of CG-213).** Do not build our own tool-calling loop; that is a second harness to maintain forever. If OpenRouter ships in phase 05, do it as option b, an adapter around an existing OpenAI-compatible CLI, and only after item 1 can read the result. The 20 to 50 task evaluation corpus and compatibility suite in the routing spec are phase 06.
- **TUI parity tasks filed by default.** CG-226 was a whole task to give the TUI an answer flow the web already had. Keep the TUI thin and stop filing parity tasks until a TUI user reports missing one.
- **Running fast to close the phase.** The fast stop and 7 workers cut wall-clock, but the operator's numbers show the rate fell and the bill per task did not. Until item 1 exists, changes to the operating point are guesses.

**5. Questions for the human.**

1. **Is phase 05 about adoption or about cost?** The stub says both: a second team on its own machines and models, and cost per accepted task. They pull in different directions for a phase of this size. Name the one sentence.
2. **Who is the second team?** If nobody is named, CG-215 and CG-216 test against fixtures, not users. Is there a real repository to onboard before the phase closes?
3. **How many drafts may a retro file?** CG-187 files every finding at every severity. Should the retro file only high findings as tasks and keep the rest on the retro page, and what is the cap?
4. **Codex runs in bypass permission mode.** The operator set it on 2026-09-05 because the sandbox blocked git and network. That is a trust decision the fence and the scrubbed environment now carry alone. Ratify or revert.
5. **Phase 05's numbers.** Cost per accepted easy task at or under $4 and first-pass approval at or above 90% are the numbers I would set. Are they yours?
6. **Decisions made in your name this phase**, to ratify in the closing document: `automerge_method: merge`, `review.max_rounds: 4`, reviews on the easy tier, the codex tier map, and the eight queue-rotation hand merges.

Small things I found on the way, for the planner rather than for you: the operator skill template in scaffold.py still says any config change needs a restart; `garden take` flips a draft to ready without the brief-gap check CG-193 added; `docs/design.md` and `docs/roadmap.md` still list automatic merging as not planned while the queue is on in the live garden; and a `->` inside a button's title attribute breaks the walkthrough's text rendering, so persona readers see "tasks">Plan phase" on the phase page.
