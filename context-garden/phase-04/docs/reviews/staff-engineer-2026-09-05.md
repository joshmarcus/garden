Phase 04 delivered the structure it promised: one writer for merge-queue state with a test that enforces it, one approve gate, one recorded rebase helper, per-key state merging, restart recovery, honest GitHub fakes and a shared fake contract; the suite is green and fast. Two phase-04 decisions created data-integrity hazards that get costlier with time: task files are written whole with no concurrency control now that actions and ticks run unlocked, and retro-filed drafts take live ids into a branch that merges later, and in both cases a duplicate id is a fatal exception that stops every page and tick. Beneath that, status is still assigned outside _transition in eight places, the check-run state machine is stringly typed with duplicated tails, and the twenty-mixin scheduler has no declared interface and nothing enforcing its size cap.

## High

- **store/concurrency** — Task files are written whole from a stale in-memory Task, so a web or CLI action between a tick's read and its _transition is silently overwritten, and a mid-tick move resurrects the old file into a fatal duplicate id.
  - suggestion: Give Store.save optimistic concurrency keyed on the on-disk updated stamp (re-read and re-apply only changed fields on mismatch) or re-read in _transition; add a test that interleaves an action between a tick's read and save.
- **retro/ids** — _finish_retro reserves ids from the live counter but writes the drafts into a branch, so any task created live before the retro PR merges collides and Store.tasks() raises for every page and tick after the merge.
  - suggestion: Make a duplicate id a validate() problem that flags the newer file and keeps serving; give branch-filed drafts a non-colliding id via a reservation in state.json or a retro-scoped suffix.

## Medium

- **scheduler/_transition** — Eight places (web done/unapprove, CLI set-status/take, approve, _approve_retro_blocking, attach_pr, discovered hold) assign task.status directly, emitting no transition event and forcing the terminal-state sweep to exist as a backstop.
  - suggestion: Add Scheduler.mark_done and unapprove, route all status writes through _transition, and add a source-grep test like test_queue_state.py asserting no other module assigns .status =
- **scheduler/checkruns** — The check-run continuation is eight string stages over untyped cont dicts, reap_check clears the pointer before the handler runs so a handler failure leaves no pointer and no transition, and _after_push/_open_pr_after_checks and the two reprobe paths duplicate the same tails.
  - suggestion: Introduce a CheckContinuation dataclass with a stage enum, clear check_run only after the handler succeeds (transition to failed with a card otherwise), and fold each mirrored tail into one function.
- **scheduler/structure** — Twenty mixins make 143 undeclared cross-mixin calls to underscore helpers, reap.py is 29 lines under the 800-line cap and nothing enforces the cap.
  - suggestion: Add a test that no module under src/garden exceeds 800 lines, declare a SchedulerBase Protocol for the shared helpers, and move _reprobe_base_broken into checkruns.py.
- **tests** — _run_specs_in/_pre_pr_checks live in reap.py only for tests/test_setup.py, and the CG-184 test asserts the literal 62ch is absent from CSS rather than any behaviour.
  - suggestion: Test run_check_job directly and delete the two helpers; replace the 62ch assertion with a layout check or drop it.

## Low

- **scheduler/quota** — _handle_quota_env_error undoes attempts/revisions/rebases counters that dispatch already incremented, with env_snapshot written partly by dispatch and partly by answer() after the run started.
  - suggestion: Count a round at successful finalize instead of at dispatch, and have dispatch own env_snapshot for every mode.
- **harness/classification** — Quota and auth env_errors are substring matches over the whole final message and stdout, so a worker quoting the phrase pauses its harness and loops the task back to ready without counting an attempt.
  - suggestion: Match only the harness's own error field and is_error result, and cap consecutive env-error returns per task.
- **docs** — The architecture module map omits kickoff.py, scheduler/kickoff.py, profiles.py, inbox.py and pages/costs, and RESTART_KEYS marks github.* as restart-only though garden serve rebuilds the scheduler every tick.
  - suggestion: Add a test that every module appears in the map (like the README test) and make garden watch rebuild its scheduler per tick so the two loops behave the same.

## Full report

_Restored by the operator from the run output after the run was misread as a login failure (CG-237)._

I've finished reading the scheduler, web, store and test layers and running the checks. Now writing up the review.

**What I ran:** the full suite passes (962 passed, 3 skipped, 115s) and ruff is clean. No module exceeds the 800-line cap, though `scheduler/reap.py` sits at 771 and `cli/loop.py` at 726.

## Overall

Phase 04 is a strong structural phase. The single-writer work landed as designed: `scheduler/queue.py` is the only writer of merge-queue state and a source-grepping test enforces it, `approve` is one gate, `_rebase_and_record` is one recorded rebase, and `State.save` merges per key under a file lock. The fakes now model check latency and base deletion, and `GitHubLike` keeps the two fakes honest. Restart recovery in `reap_on_start` and the once-only `run_finished` are the kind of fixes that make an overnight loop plausible.

Two decisions made this phase created data-integrity hazards that will get more expensive the longer they sit, and the scheduler's mixin coupling is growing faster than anything checks it.

## Findings, ranked by cost to fix later

1. **High. Task files have no concurrency protection across the action/tick split.** CG-182 lets a web action and a tick each build a scheduler and write without a shared lock. That is safe for `state.json`, which merges per key, but a task file is written whole from an in-memory `Task` the tick read at its start. A cancel, priority change or log line written by an action mid-tick is silently overwritten when `_transition` saves the stale object. Worse, a `move` mid-tick makes the tick re-create the old file, and `Store.tasks()` then raises on the duplicate id, which takes down every page and every subsequent tick until someone deletes a file by hand. The only test for CG-182 asserts latency, not correctness. Fix: give `Store.save` optimistic concurrency (record the on-disk `updated` stamp at load, re-read and re-apply only the fields the caller changed on mismatch), or have `_transition` re-read the task from disk before writing. Add a test that interleaves an action between a tick's read and its save.

2. **High. Retro-filed drafts reserve ids from the live counter but land in a branch that merges later.** `_finish_retro` reads `store.next_id` and writes `prefix-NNN` files into the retro worktree. Any task created live before that PR merges takes the same number: a kickoff spike, a discovered draft, the new-task form. After the merge the garden has two files with one id and `Store.tasks()` raises. The same fatal-exception design amplifies finding 1. Fix: make a duplicate id a `validate()` problem that flags the newer file and keeps serving, and give branch-filed drafts an id that cannot collide, either a reservation recorded in `state.json` or a retro-scoped suffix resolved at merge.

3. **Medium. Status is still assigned outside `_transition` in eight places.** The web `done` and `unapprove` actions, CLI `set-status` and `take`, `Scheduler.approve`, `_approve_retro_blocking`, `attach_pr` and the discovered hold-as-draft path all set `task.status` directly. None emits a `transition` event or notifies, and the terminal-state sweep added in CG-195 exists precisely because these writers do not clean up. Goal 5 asked for approve and mark_done to go through `_transition`; approve is one gate but not one writer. Fix: add `Scheduler.mark_done` and `unapprove`, route everything through `_transition`, and add a source-grep test in the style of `test_queue_state.py` that no other module assigns `.status =`.

4. **Medium. The check-run state machine is stringly typed and clears its pointer before the handler runs.** Eight stage names map to handlers that index untyped `cont` dicts persisted in `state.json`. `reap_check` empties `check_run` before calling the handler, so a handler exception leaves the task with no pointer and no transition; it recovers only by accident through `_is_unreaped` re-running the whole finalize, fence check included. Two tails are also duplicated: `_after_push` mirrors `_open_pr_after_checks`, and `_reprobe_base_broken` repeats the "base recovered" branch of `_after_reprobe_check`. Fix: a `CheckContinuation` dataclass with a stage enum and explicit serialisation, clear the pointer after the handler succeeds and transition to `failed` with a card when it does not, and fold each mirrored tail into one function.

5. **Medium. Cross-mixin coupling has no declared interface and nothing enforces the size cap.** `Scheduler` is now twenty mixins with 143 calls to underscore methods defined in other mixins. No type checker can verify them and `reap.py` is 29 lines from the cap. Fix: a test asserting every module under `src/garden` stays under 800 lines, a `SchedulerBase` Protocol naming the shared helpers each mixin depends on, and move `_reprobe_base_broken` from reap into checkruns where its continuation lives.

6. **Medium. Test-only production code and implementation-asserting tests.** `_run_specs_in` and `_pre_pr_checks` in reap.py are kept only for `tests/test_setup.py`. The CG-184 test asserts the string `62ch` is absent from rendered CSS, which is a pure implementation assertion. Fix: test `run_check_job` directly and delete the two helpers; replace the CSS test with a layout assertion or drop it.

7. **Low. Quota recovery relies on compensating decrements.** `_handle_quota_env_error` subtracts the `attempts`, `revisions` and `rebases` that `dispatch` already added, and the snapshot it restores from is written partly by `dispatch` and partly by `answer()` after the run has started. Fix: count a round at successful finalize instead, and let `dispatch` own `env_snapshot` for every mode.

8. **Low. Environment-error classification is a substring match over the whole transcript.** `_quota_kind` and `AUTH_FAILURE_MARKERS` scan the final message and stdout, so a worker that quotes "not logged in" or "usage limit" pauses its harness and returns the task to ready without counting an attempt, and a repeated false positive loops forever. Fix: match only the harness's own error field, and cap consecutive env-error returns per task.

9. **Low. Documentation drifted from the mechanism.** The architecture module map omits `kickoff.py`, `scheduler/kickoff.py`, `profiles.py`, `inbox.py` and `web/pages/costs`. `RESTART_KEYS` says the `github.*` settings need a restart, which is true for `garden watch` (one scheduler for the process) but not for `garden serve`, which builds a fresh scheduler per tick. Fix: a test that every module appears in the map, mirroring the README test, and make `watch` rebuild its scheduler per tick so the two loops agree.
