# usability-expert review of context-garden/phase-04

**Persona:** usability-expert · **Score:** 6/10 · 2026-09-05T22:51:04+00:00

Phase 04 fixed the two things a new person hits first: the README now walks to a running garden in the order the CLI enforces, and refusals and failure cards say what happened and what to do. But the phase's headline gate has two doors left open on the very pages it guards: 'Dispatch now' on a draft dispatches a placeholder brief silently (and twice on two presses), and the New task form's 'approve now' writes ready directly, so placeholder criteria still reach a worker. Around that, one garden shows three different needs-you counts, the Config page lists tick_interval as both live and restart-only, the generated operator skill still says every config change needs a restart, and the walkthrough tool that feeds these reviews renders hidden panels and mangles attributes. Close the two bypasses and unify the counts and this is an 8.

## High

- **task page** — 'Dispatch now' is offered on a draft and dispatches it without the approve gate, with no flash, and a second press starts a second run and orphans the first.
  - suggestion: Hide Dispatch now for drafts or route it through Scheduler.approve first so brief gaps refuse; refuse when a run is already in flight; flash 'dispatched <run>' on success.
- **new task form** — The phase page's New task form with 'approve now' writes status ready directly, so a task with placeholder criteria lands ready and the only feedback is 'created WID-004'.
  - suggestion: Create the task as a draft, then call Scheduler.approve; on refusal keep it a draft and flash the gap with the file path.

## Medium

- **approve card** — The Inbox approve card still offers Approve as the action for a brief it says is incomplete, names no file, and the CLI cuts the note mid-word ('fix before app').
  - suggestion: Name the task file on the card, disable or relabel Approve until the gaps clear, and wrap rather than truncate the CLI note.
- **needs-you counts** — With one failed task, garden inbox and garden observe say '1 need you' while garden status shows the '!' column empty, and the rail says 'Runs $0' beside '$0.22 spent in 24h'.
  - suggestion: One shared needs-you predicate used by status, inbox, observe and the rail badge; show cents in the rail below $1.
- **config page** — tick_interval is listed under both live values and needs-a-restart, the profile table's retro column is '—' for every stop while the copy says a stop sets the retro tier, and the panel eyebrow reads 'CG-221'.
  - suggestion: Exclude RESTART_KEYS from the live list, fill or drop the retro column, and replace task ids in UI and help text with the feature's name.
- **operator skill** — The garden-operate skill written by garden init still says 'Any config change needs a restart', contradicting the Config page and README, which say restart only after a tick.
  - suggestion: Update the scaffold template to say garden.yaml reloads each tick and only RESTART_KEYS need a restart.
- **walkthrough capture** — The walkthrough's text rendering shows hidden panels (the whole discuss prompt) as page text and turns a '->' in a title attribute into visible 'tasks">Plan phase', and no phase-04 capture is committed yet.
  - suggestion: Render with an HTML parser that skips hidden elements and attributes; run garden walkthrough as a step of closing the phase.

## Low

- **CLI help** — garden --help opens with an unnamed Commands panel holding move, retro-decide and canary above Setting up.
  - suggestion: Give those three commands a rich_help_panel.
- **CLI first run** — init and new-phase print absolute paths wrapped mid-word, new-task does not say to fill the criteria before approving, and an empty garden's status and observe give no next step.
  - suggestion: Print paths relative to the garden root and add a one-line 'Next:' hint to new-task, status and observe when the garden has no ready work.
- **costs page** — Resume runs appear under 'other' in the activity breakdown with no explanation.
  - suggestion: Add resume to the activity vocabulary or label the bucket 'other (resume)'.

## Full report

_Restored by the operator from the run output after the run was misread as a login failure (CG-237)._

I have what I need. Servers are stopped and the worktree is untouched (`git status` clean). Here is the review.

## Usability review of phase-04, context-garden

I followed the README from nothing to a running garden with this checkout's `garden`, using the test fake as the harness, then drove the web UI on that garden and on the throwaway garden `garden qa --scripted --keep` leaves behind, capturing every page with `garden walkthrough`. Quotes below are what those pages and commands actually printed.

**Task 1: the first five minutes from the README.** This is the phase's clearest win. The README is now a real front door, and the sequence it gives is the one the CLI enforces. `garden doctor` names a fix beside every failure and closes with `failed: github, git identity`. The approve gate reads exactly as it should:

```
WID-001 has an incomplete brief; fix it before approving: acceptance criteria
are placeholders (fill `## Acceptance criteria` with testable items)
```

Where a new person hesitates:
- `garden --help` opens with an unnamed "Commands" panel holding `move`, `retro-decide` and `canary`, above "Setting up". The first command a newcomer reads is `canary`.
- `garden init` and `garden new-phase` print absolute paths that wrap mid-word at 80 columns ("e4b0 / c19e…"). `garden new-task` prints "created WID-001 at …" and nothing about filling in the criteria, so the very next command in the README, `garden approve`, refuses.
- After the refusal, the Inbox card (web and CLI) still offers Approve as its action. The web card says "Fix the brief before approving — a run would be spent on: …" but does not name the file, and there is no way in the UI to edit the brief. The CLI card cuts the note mid-word: "brief incomplete, fix before app".
- An empty garden's `garden status` is a row of thirteen dots with a legend, and `garden observe` says "service no runs yet". Neither says what to do next.

**Task 2: get one task through the loop from the web.** The refusal is consistent on the card, the task page and "Approve all drafts". But the phase's headline promise, no task dispatched with placeholder criteria, has two open doors on the same pages:
- The task page shows "Dispatch now" on a draft. Pressing it dispatched my placeholder-criteria draft with no flash at all. Pressing it again ten seconds later started a second run and the first was later "closed: no active run pointer references it and its process has exited". The action never consults the approve gate or checks for a run in flight (`src/garden/web/templates/task.html:77`, `src/garden/web/actions/tasks.py:67`).
- The phase page's New task form with "approve now" ticked writes `status: ready` directly (`src/garden/web/actions/phases.py:269`). My task with `- [ ] ...` criteria landed as ready, showed in `garden ready`, and the only feedback was "created WID-004".

When my run failed, the surface was excellent: the card says "The garden hit an environment error", explains "Dispatch, push or git failed on the garden's side; the worker never got a fair run", lists three options with one-line consequences, and offers a copyable prompt. Two blemishes: "Continue the loop" appears twice on the task page, and the three needs-you counts disagree. With one failed task, `garden inbox` and `garden observe` say "1 need you" while `garden status` shows the "!" column empty, because status counts only the needs_human flag (`src/garden/cli/views.py:57` versus `:212`). The rail also reads "Runs $0" beside "$0.22 spent in 24h".

**Task 3: come back in the morning as the operator.** `garden observe` is a good single screen, and the Config page now says which keys are live, which is what the phase promised. Where a returning operator misreads:
- `tick_interval` appears in both "Effective values · live (re-read each tick)" and "Needs a restart". The operating-profile table's "retro" column is "—" for all three stops while the copy says a stop sets the retro tier. The panel's eyebrow reads "CG-221", a task id, and the same id is in `garden profile --help`.
- The garden-operate skill that `garden init` writes still says "**Any config change needs a restart.**" An operator agent that reads it first, as the README instructs, will restart the service for every edit, against the README's own warning to restart only after a tick.
- On the Costs page, resume runs are grouped as "other" with no explanation.
- The walkthrough tool, which is what personas like me read, renders hidden panels as page text (the whole discuss prompt appears inline on the Inbox) and turns a `->` in a button's title attribute into visible `tasks">Plan phase`. A reviewer reading the .txt will file phantom bugs. No phase-04 capture exists in the garden repo yet, although the definition of done asks for one.

What worked well and should stay: the README, doctor's fixes, the approve refusal wording, the failed-task card with its discuss prompt, "Inbox zero", the retro page's empty state naming `garden retro demo/p1`, the merge-queue panel copy, the help panels and `--version`, `garden status` at 80 columns, and the tick line "took 0.1s; slowest: reap 0.1s".
